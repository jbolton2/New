    * presence sensors are Bob, Jane
    
 * Operation
     * At sunset, check if we are in **AWAY** mode, within Time, and  Bob and Jane are not present
         * if all are true, turn on 2 randomly selected switches from the list; turn on *lights* list
         * in 33 mins;   select 2 randomly selected lights from list, turn off old selection and on new selection;  *lights* remain on
         * if time expires, or ST mode changes;  turn off all lights we have on (2 + *lights*)
         * if Bob or Jane arrive while active;  stop processing, but leave lights on that are on (we don't want them to come in and have the lights go out)
